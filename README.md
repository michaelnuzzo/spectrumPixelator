The Spectrum Pixelator is a real-time VST plugin that deconstructs a real-time audio signal into its most significant spectral components. By using advantages of the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform in eliminating time-domain artifacts, the Spectrum Pixelator alters the signal by isolating the most prominent spectral components of a signal and eliminating the remaining frequency components.
